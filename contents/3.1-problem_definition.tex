\section{Problem Definition}

In this paper, we propose a neural network model to structure the pattern of videos published by official YouTube channels of brands. The model aims to precisely predict the popularity of a video at any given time after the video is published. We maintain a list of observed brands with their activated YouTube channels shown in Appendix A \cite{comparably_2021}.

\section{Summary}

As deep neural networks is proved, by achieving the state-of-the-art results, to be beneficial to structure the underlying dependencies of temporal features and cascade graph, this research will focus on developing deep neural network model based on the experiments shown in previous works. We will try to integrate the advantages of feature-based models and deep learning models to construct a interpretable model which can effectively predict popularity given specific time in a social network.

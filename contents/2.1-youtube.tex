\section{YouTube and Social Networking}

Being one of the most popular video content websites, YouTube has gained lots of attention in both academic and industrial fields. YouTube is not just a content-sharing platform but a social network with more than 1.5 billion registered users and can upload videos whenever they want. Their released YouTube Data API provides researchers easy access to YouTube video data. Many studies utilize the large-scale data of YouTube to observe and model the relationship between video attributes and video popularity. A user's content popularity can be predicted by examining user popularity in social and content facets \cite{37738}. Some studies such as \cite{10.1145/1298306.1298309} are interested in modeling the life cycle of YouTube videos that can provide supportive information to decision makers. Investigation of the social networking mechanisms and their impacts on video popularity of YouTube is also conducted in several studies \cite{4539688, 37738}. While \cite{37738} indicates that there are strong relationships between content creators, \cite{4539688} implies that videos are correlated with each other closely. Taking advantage of the massive traffic of YouTube, many brands release videos to improve their brand image and brand association \cite{Febriyantoro2020ExploringYM}. Therefore, finding influential factors of YouTube video consumption became valuable to businesses to determine which strategy is more suitable to their brand images \cite{article}.
